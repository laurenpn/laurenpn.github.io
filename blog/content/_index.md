# Lauren Pusey-Nazzaro
*About:* I am a mathematics PhD student at the University of Minnesota, advised by [Tian-Jun Li](https://cse.umn.edu/math/tian-jun-li). My research interests are in symplectic topology and enumerative geometry.

<!-- My research interests are in symplectic geometry. -->
- [Comparing Gromov-Witten type invariants on semipositive symplectic manifolds](/assets/notes/integralGW.pdf): this note explains why ordinary Gromov-Witten invariants for semipositive symplectic manifolds are equal to invariants defined by [Bai-Xu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02688).
- I am also setting up a [blog](/posts/), but nothing is there yet.
